🐦 Birdcall: Classification and Extinction Alert using Deep Learning (Hybrid Model)

This project focuses on the automatic classification of bird species based on their vocalizations (birdcalls) using a hybrid deep learning model. It aims to support wildlife conservation by identifying endangered or extinct bird species from audio data, helping researchers and ecologists monitor biodiversity efficiently.

🌍 Project Overview

Bird species identification through sound is a vital tool for ecological studies. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and error-prone — this project leverages deep learning and audio signal processing to classify birdcalls and trigger alerts for endangered or extinct species.

The model processes Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) extracted from bird audio clips and uses a hybrid CNN model combining EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121 to achieve accurate multi-class classification.

🧠 Model Architecture

Feature Extraction: MFCCs and spectrograms generated from bird audio

Base Models:

EfficientNetB0 – for efficient lightweight feature extraction

DenseNet121 – for deep hierarchical pattern recognition

Fusion: Feature concatenation layer merging both models’ outputs

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy

Activation: ReLU + Softmax

🎯 Objective

To build a smart, accurate, and eco-focused model that can:

Classify bird species using their calls

Detect endangered or extinct bird species automatically

Assist in conservation research and biodiversity tracking
